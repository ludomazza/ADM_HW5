In this folder you will find: 
- a .ipynb file where there are points 1,2,3,6 of the homework;
- a .sh file where the command line is;
- an "output" folder where there are the outputs of two tests done to see if the functionalities actually worked but which, being too long, were saved as .txt files so as not to burden the main.ipynb file;
